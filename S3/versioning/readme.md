What is versioning
------------------
We can enable versioning in s3 so we can have multiple versions of an object within s3.

Advantages Of Versioning & Important Points
-------------------------------------------
All Versions - All versions of an object are stored in s3. This includes all writes and even if we delete an object.
Backup - Can be a backup tool.
Cannot Be Disabled - Once the versioning is enabled we cannot disable it. We can only suspend it.
Lifecycle Rules  - Can be integrated with lifecycle rules.
Supports MFA - Can support multi-factor authentication.
