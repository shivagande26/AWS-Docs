Securing Our Data
------------------
-> Serverside Encryption.
   We can set default encryption on a bucket to encrypt all new objects when they are stored in the buckets.
-> Access Control Lists(ACLs).
   Define which AWS accounts or groups are granted access and the type of access. We can attach S3 ACLs to individual objects as well.
-> Bucket Policies.
   S3 bucket policies specifies what actions are allowed or denied.

Important Points To Remember
----------------------------
-> S3 is an object based storage allows us to upload files.
-> Not suitable to install any OS or run any database.
-> Files can be uploaded to S3 with the size from from 0 bytes to 5TB.
-> The number of objects we can upload to S3 is unlimited.
